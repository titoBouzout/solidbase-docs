# Breaking Changes

TODO: Write about breaking changes.

## Markup

HTML has always been a first class citizen in Solid. "A `div` is a `div`".

```jsx
const div = <div />; // HTMLDivElement
```

However, there were a few markup gotchas that this release addresses.

Solid 2.0 aligns better with web standards, making it easier to understand and explain. The main idea is that referencing [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/) should suffice, and no Solid-specific rules are introduced.

### Attributes Case

`camelCase` attributes has been dropped in favor of `lowercase` attributes.

Solid 1.x

```jsx
<img crossOrigin="anonymous" />
```

Solid 2.x

```jsx
<img crossorigin="anonymous" />
```

Note: Attributes in `XML` space, such as `SVG` are still case-sensitive per specification.

### Properties

Elements use attributes and not properties.
However, the following few commonly used properties are still provided to ease development: `innerHTML`, `textContent` and `innerText`.

```jsx
<div textContent="<b>bold tag example</b>" />
```

As usual, to set a property, or a custom property in an element see [`prop:`](https://docs.solidjs.com/reference/jsx-attributes/prop).

```jsx
<my-el prop:someProp={true}></my-el>
```

### Boolean Attributes

A [Boolean Attribute](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Boolean/HTML) is an attribute that is present or not present.
Commonly authored as `<input readonly/>` or `<input readonly=""/>`.
Solid represents Boolean Attribute using `boolean`.

`true: boolean` adds an empty attribute:

```jsx
<input readonly={true} />
<input readonly /> // in JSX a lack of value equals `true: boolean`
<input readonly="" /> // for compatibility with HTML an empty string may be used
```

`false: boolean` removes the attribute:

```jsx
<input readonly={false} />
```

Note: It has to be `boolean`.
`truthy` and `falsy` won't work.

### Enumerated Attributes

An [Enumerated Attribute](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Enumerated) is an attribute that allows a `string` value from a fixed set of possible `string` values.

```jsx
<input type="text"/>
<input type="button"/>
```

A commonly confusing issue with Enumerated Attributes, is that some accept among its values the strings `"true"` and `"false"`.
These are strings that happen to match the boolean identifiers but aren't boolean per se.

For example, the correct use for [ARIA Attributes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Boolean/ARIA) is a `string` and not a `boolean`.

```jsx
<span aria-hidden="true"/> // ✅ correct use
<span aria-hidden="false"/> // ✅ correct use
<span aria-hidden={true}/> // ❌ incorrect use
```

### Removing Attributes

Any attribute can be removed using `undefined` or `false: boolean`.

### class and classList

`classList` attribute has been dropped and its behaviour has been merged into `class`.
Making `class` behave similarly to [clsx](https://www.npmjs.com/package/clsx).

Example:

```jsx
<div class={[...props.class, "myclass", { "other-class": signal() }]} />
```

```ts
// type for illustrative purposes only - consult type definitions for reference

type class = string | ClassList

type ClassList =
	| Record<string, boolean>
	| Array<
			string | number | boolean | null | undefined | Record<string, boolean>
	  >;
```

### Deprecated Namespaces

`bool:` and `attr:` namespaces became superflous and have been removed.

### Event Handlers

Lowercase event handlers were supported but not encouraged.
This release drops support for `lowercase` event handlers in favor of the `camelCase` form.

```jsx
<div onClick={() => console.log('click')}/> // ✅ correct use
<div onclick={() => console.log('click')}/> // ❌ no longer supported
```

Having multiple ways of doing the same thing made authoring components difficult, as both forms had to be supported.

Components authors often provide callbacks that resemble event handlers, such `onSelectedChange` in [Kobalte](https://kobalte.dev/docs/core/overview/introduction/), `onInitialFocus` in [corvu](https://corvu.dev/), and `onOpenChange` in [Nitropage](https://nitropage.org/).
Using `camelCase` makes it consistent with community use and expectations.

Note: For custom event handlers see [`on:`](https://docs.solidjs.com/reference/jsx-attributes/on).
